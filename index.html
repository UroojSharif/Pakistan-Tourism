              pre-cooked, then layered in a pot, sealed, and slowly cooked on an
              open fire (on dum). It's spicier than its counterparts, with a

              yogurt and dried plums introducing complex plays of spicy-sour

              Haleem is perhaps one of the most eminent dishes associated with
              Muslim communities across Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. It's a
              unique dish made by slow-cooking wheat (or barley), meat (beef,
              mutton, or goat), and lentils with copious amounts of ghee,
              spices, rose petals, and nuts until richly fragrant and thick.
              Once garnished with julienned ginger, crispy caramelized onions,
              and zesty cilantro, it's irresistible to those who know its
              delights.

              No kebab can compare to the juicy, succulent, and crispy chapli
              kebab straight off the skillets of Peshawari street vendors.
              Imagine tender minced beef mince mixed with tomatoes, onions,
              tangy pomegranate seeds, green chili peppers, citrusy lemon juice,
              fresh herbs, eggs, and plenty of fresh spices: That's chapli
              kebab. It's best served with fluffy naan to soak up the juices and
              a crisp fresh salad.

              We're confident that most people know Pakistan for its curries and
              kebabs — but have you tried the sweet desserts? While you'll
              frequently find people snacking on English biscuits with tea, a
              wealth of more traditional desserts are ready to be explored.
